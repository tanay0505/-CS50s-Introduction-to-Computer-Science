Course: CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science
Project: Final Project

Project Overview
This project, Mail, is a simplified web-based email application, similar to Gmail. It is designed to provide
a user-friendly experience with core email functionality, including user registration, login/logout, sending
and receiving emails, and replying to emails. This README provides an in-depth description of the features,
setup, and usage.


Features
1. User Registration and Login
Register: Users can create an account with a unique username and password. If the username is already taken,
they will be prompted to choose a different one.
Password Security: Passwords are securely hashed and displayed as dots when inputted to enhance security and
privacy.
Login and Logout: After registering, users can log in and log out of the application securely.
2. Email Functionalities
Inbox: The main view where users can see a list of received emails. For each email, basic details like the
sender and subject are displayed.
Compose: Users can create a new email by entering the recipient, subject, and message content. This section
provides a simple, intuitive form for email composition.
Sent: The “Sent” folder displays all emails that the user has sent, providing an easy way to keep track of
outgoing communication.
Reply to Email: Users can reply to emails directly from the inbox, ensuring continuity in conversations and
ease of access to previous threads.
View Email Button: Each email in the inbox has a “View Email” button, which lets users see the full details
of the selected email.

Project Structure
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to create the user interface and manage interactions.
Backend: Flask (Python) is used for managing server-side logic, including handling requests and responses
for registration, login, email composition, and retrieval.
Database: SQLite is used as the database for managing user data and email content.
Main Pages:
Register - Allows users to sign up for an account.
Login - Securely log in to the application.
Inbox - Displays a list of received emails.
Compose - Allows users to write and send a new email.
Sent - Displays a list of emails that the user has sent.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Flask for managing the backend logic.
SQLite for the database (included with Python by default).
Jinja2 for templating in Flask.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_link>
cd mail
Install Dependencies: Make sure to install the necessary packages by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up the Database: Initialize the database with the required tables for users and emails.

bash
Copy code
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade
Run the Application: Start the Flask server:

bash
Copy code
flask run
Access the Application: Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your web browser to access the Mail application.

Usage
Register: Click on the "Register" button to create a new account. If the username is already taken,
you’ll be prompted to choose a different one.

Login: Use your credentials to log in. If the username or password is incorrect, an error message will
 appear.

Inbox: Upon logging in, you’ll be directed to the inbox where you can view received emails. For each email,
 a "View Email" button allows you to see its full details.

Compose: Navigate to the “Compose” section to create a new email. Enter the recipient's username, subject,
 and message body, and click "Send" to deliver the email.

Sent: In the “Sent” section, you can see all emails you’ve sent. Each email includes details like the
recipient and subject.

Reply to Email: In the inbox, select an email to reply to by clicking the "Reply" button. This will open
a new compose form pre-filled with the recipient and original message, allowing you to continue the conversation seamlessly.

Security Measures
Password Hashing: Passwords are securely hashed to protect user data.
Secure Form Handling: Data submitted in forms, such as usernames and passwords, is handled securely
to prevent unauthorized access.
Future Improvements
Some potential enhancements for this project include:

Adding support for email attachments.
Implementing a search feature to find emails by subject or sender.
Adding categories or folders for better email organization.

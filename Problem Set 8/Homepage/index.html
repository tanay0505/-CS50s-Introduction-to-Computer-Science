          <h2 class="title">Definition</h2>
          <p>
            [Minecraft] - the word has it origins traced back to the english language,
            result of combining two words: [Mine] and [Craft], and those two words
            defines the foundation of this wonderful game, that is, mining and crafting.
          </p>

          <h2 class="title">What is it</h2>
          <p>
            Minecraft is a sandbox game where you can create your own worlds and
            experiences using building blocks and resources. It is available on multiple
            platforms such as computers, smartphones, tablets and consoles.
            <br><br>
            But actually, that definition is a little lame, so let's try again.
            <br><br>
            Minecraft is a game that combines elements of multiple types of games as
            construction, exploration, survival and adventure. The thing is that it does
            in a fully modifiable three-dimensional procedurally generated world, that
            is it's a random world every time you create a new one, so the gameplay is
            never the same. And the world is infinite! Ok, maybe not infinite but it is.
            Definitely one of the funniest games to play with friends.

                    Those blocks are one-cubic-meter-sized and there are hundreds of
                    different blocks. In addition to blocks, the environment features
                    plants, mobs and items.

                      In survival mode you can die by many ways like starved, drowned,
                      burned, killed by monsters, and more, so you have to collect
                      items, and survive. The game has achievements so even though the
                      game does not tell you the objective is accomplish those achievements
                      and in the process kill the bosses like the EnderDragon or the
                      Wither. You can die as many times as you want but you could lose
                      your items in the process.<br><br>

                    <li>
                      In creative mode you are immortal and it allow you to build
                      anything you want because you have all the items and, you can fly
                      and more, so the only thing holding you back in that mode is your
                      creativity.<br><br>

                    <li>
                      In adventure mode you can die but your interaction with the world
                      is limited, that is to experience a story that someone made for example.<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In spectator mode you can fly and pass through blocks, that is
                      to watch whatever there are to be watched.<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In hardcore mode you can die only once, and the world is erased
                      if you die and you lose all the progress, that is for the sigmas.

                    new features to the game, way more than Mojang could even implement,
                    that you can easily try out.

                    including a lot of very well implemented stuff to build minigames and
                    features, allowing for many different experiences, the community is very
                    creative. Besides if you want to play the normal game with your friends
                    you can enter their single-player maps and play together.

              Minecraft was created by <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Persson"
              target="_blank">Markus Persson</a>, a Swedish person named Markus... And he
              is a video game programmer, designer, genius, billionaire, playboy and a
              philanthropist. Who is also known as Notch.
              <br><br>
              He and his team worked on the game at <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojang_Studios"
              target="_blank">Mojang Studios</a> until 2014, when the game was sold
              to Microsoft for U$ 2.5 billion.
              <br><br>
              Notch has since left Mojang and is no longer working in the game.

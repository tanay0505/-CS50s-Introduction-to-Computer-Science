If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
    By taking the values of the three averages with: SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs; and these three values would represent their audio aura
    just like three values of red, green and blue represent a color.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
    An user that only listens to songs with energy, valence and danceability equals to 0.5 would have the same audio aura as someone who listens to songs with a lot
    of variance in the values of energy, valence and danceability but that in the end gets an average of 0.5 in each one.

    Therefore, maybe by representing the audio aura not just by three values, but by six values: the averages of energy, valence and danceability and the standard deviations
    of each one would be a better representation of their music taste.
